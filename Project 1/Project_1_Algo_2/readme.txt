Matching Group Schedules 
Find the available meeting times between two peoples available times that are at or longer 30 minute duration

Description
The  group  schedule  matching  problem  takes  two  or  more  arrays  as  input.  The  arrays  represent 
availabilities  and  daily  working  periods  of  group  members.  The  output  is  an  array  containing 
intervals of time when all members are available for a meeting.  The group schedule problem can 
be defined as shown below:

Assume there are at least two persons in your class project group. You want to schedule a meeting 
with another group member. You are provided with (a) a schedule of membersâ€™ daily activities, 
containing times of planned  engagements. They  are not available to have a meeting  you  during 
these periods; (b) the earliest and latest times at which they are available for meetings daily. Your 
schedule and availabilities are provided too.  
 
Write an algorithm that takes in your schedule, your daily availability (earliest time, latest time) 
and  that  of  your  group  member  (or  members),  and  the  duration  of  the  meeting  you  want  to 
schedule. Time is given and should be returned in 24hr  military format (HH:MM), for example: 
9:30, 22:21. The given times (output) should be sorted in ascending order.  
 
An  algorithm  for  solving  this  problem  may  involve  combing  the  two  sub-arrays  into  an  array 
containing a set of unavailabilities, with consideration of the daily active periods.
