Algorithm 1:  Target Terms or Substrings
Develop a complete and clear pseudocode for an algorithm to solve this problem. Your algorithm should return the indices 
of the target words (contents of array B) in ascending order of their appearance in array A. It should also print the 
words, according to the resulting order of appearance.

Description
Assume that you are given two arrays of items. The first array is a single concatenation of some notable cities in California. 
The second array contains names of some real or imaginary cities, that may be present in the first array.

Sample:
Input: 
A = [ “thismetoaklandrialtofullertonmarcolongchinofresnovallejoclovissimithound”]
B = [ ‘marco’, ‘clovis’, ‘rialto’, ‘oakland’]

Output:
Output_order = [ 7, 14, 29, 56]
Output_array =[ ‘oakland’, ‘riato’, ‘marco’, ‘clovis’]

Your output should include an array containing starting indices of the target words in array one. In the example above, oakland
is the first word, and can be found at index array_A[7]. All words are in small letters.

Dependencies
Run on windows 10 or higher

Executing program
Build and run off ide of preferred choice, include in2a.txt file since arrays are read in from that file and then parsed to strings in arrays
